1/30/23 - Creating a web based etch-a-sketch using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

1/31/23 - App is working properly. When the "Make New Grid" button is clicked the user is prompted to enter a number of rows they wish the grid to have. When the cursor enters the grid it fills each cell it passes through. If there is no pen selected, the user will be alerted to select a pen when the cursor enters the grid. The black pen fills each cell with black with every pass through. The color pen randomly selects a new rgb code with every pass through a cell. The shader pen increases opacity by 10% with every pass through a cell.
